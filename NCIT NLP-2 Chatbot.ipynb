So before we start with any NLP project we need to pre-process it to make it ideal for working. Basic text pre-processing includes:\n",
    "\n",

So, your root stem, meaning the word you end up with, is not something you can just look up in a dictionary, but you can look up a lemma. Examples of Lemmatization are that “run” is a base form for words like “running” or “ran” or that the word “better” and “good” are in the same lemma so they are considered the same.\n",

    "\n",
    "* A measure of the presence of known words.\n",

    "The intuition behind the Bag of Words is that documents are similar if they have similar content. Also, we can learn something about the meaning of the document from its content alone.\n",

    "One approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents so that the scores for frequent words like “the” that are also frequent across all documents are penalized.
